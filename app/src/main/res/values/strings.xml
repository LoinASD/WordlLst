    <string name="app_about">This very app you are looking at now was created to support TPU students who have to cope with these horrible WordLists.
        It was created between September 2017 AD and March 2018 AD.
        Idea of it was provided by LoinASD and thoughtlessly supported by Onotolo.</string>
